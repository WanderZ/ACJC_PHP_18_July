    # Welcome to PHP! This is a warm-up for the morning
    # Here we learn about variables and the echo command
    
    # Q1: There is no space between HelloWorld. Add the space between them
    
    # Q2: Change the "World" to your own name.    
    # Hint: Change $variable such that the script says 'Hello <your name> 2'
    
    # Q3: Change 1+1 such that the script calculates the multiplication of two numbers from two variables
    # Hint: To multiply two numbers: $a * $b
